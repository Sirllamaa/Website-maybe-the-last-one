                    <h2>One of the most common EV battery chemistrys is lithium-ion. The production of Li-Ion has significant environmental costs. 
                        Mining for lithium, cobalt, and nickel depletes natural resources and leads to deforestation, water scarcity, and pollution. 
                        For example, "Mining for the materials used in EV batteries is a notoriously water-intense process. Researchers estimate it 
                        takes 500,000 to 2 million gallons of water to extract just one ton[of lithium]"(Landers, 2024). Furthermore, the batteries 
                        are often produced in drought prone areas such as Chile. Infact, the carbon footprint of producing just one lithium-ion battery 
                        is 74% higher then the production of an entire pertrol car.

                    <h2>While EVs produce no tailpipe emissions, they rely on electricity from the power grid. In most regions, electricity 
                        is still predominantly generated from one of three sources; Coal, Natural gas, and Oil. This leads to charging an EV producing more greenhouse gases 
                        than driving a petrol car. Transitioning the grid to renewable energy is essential to reduceing the overall emissions of EVs.

                    <h2>Due to their heavier weight, EVs go through tires and brakes way faster than petrol cars. This produces a lot of particulate matter that ends up contributing to 
                        air pollution and can settle into soil and waterways, harming the ecosystem. While EVs are able to convert some of their kinetic energy back into chemical 
                        potential energy (in the form of batteries) from regenerative breaking, this only starts to reduce the emissions.

                    <h2>Electric vehicals offer a clear advantage when it comes to reducing tailpipe emissions, however, the environmental costs in production, electricity generation,
                         and particulate emissions can't just be ignored. Everyone must work together towards solutions like better recycling of EV batteries, cleaner electric production, 
                         and advances in breaks and tire techonolgys to truely make EV's a sustainable alternative.
